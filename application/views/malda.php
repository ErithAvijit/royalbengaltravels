		<h2 class="h">History</h2>
		<p class="p">Malda district, also spelt Maldah or Maldaha (Bengali: [malda], [maldɔɦ], often [maldɔɦo]; is a district in West Bengal, India. It lies 347 km (215 miles) north of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. Mango, jute and silk are the most notable products of this district. The special variety of mango, Fazli, produced in this region is popularly known by the name of the district and is exported across the world and internationally acclaimed. The folk culture of gombhira is a feature of the district, being a unique way of representation of joy and sorrow of daily life of the common people, as well as the unique medium of presentation on national and international matters. According to the National Investigation Agency Malda is believed to be a hub of a fake currency racket. It is reported that 90 per cent of the fake currency that enters India originates in Malda.

District headquarters is English Bazar, also known as Malda, which was once the capital of Bengal. The district maintains the traditions of the past in culture and education. Old Malda, the town which lies just east of the confluence of the Mahananda and Kalindi rivers, is part of the English Bazar metropolitan city. The town rose to prominence as the river port of the old capital of Pandua. During the 18th century it was the seat of prosperous cotton and silk industries. It remains an important distributing centre for rice, jute, and wheat. The area between the historical monument of Jame Masjid (1566) and the landmark of Nimasarai tower across the river Mahananda, constituted a municipality in 1867. Rice, jute, legumes, and oilseed are the chief crops in the surrounding area. Malda is the largest producer of excellent quality of jute in India. Mulberry plantations and mango orchards occupy large areas; mango trade and silk manufacture are the main economic activities. The Independence Day of Malda is 17 August 1947</p>

	<div>Gauḍa (also known as Gaur, Gour,[1] Lakhnauti, and Jannatabad) is a historic city of Bengal in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent,[2] and one of the most prominent capitals in classical and medieval Indian subcontinent. Located on the border between India and Bangladesh, with most of its ruins on the Indian side and a few structures on the Bangladeshi side, it was once one of the most populous cities in the world. The ruins of this former city now straddle the international border and are divided between the Malda district of West Bengal and Chapai Nawabganj District of Rajshahi Division. The Kotwali Gate, formerly part of the citadel, now marks the border checkpoint between the two countries.

Gauda was the capital city of Bengal under several kingdoms. The Gauda region was also a province of several pan-Indian empires. During the 7th century, the Gauda Kingdom was founded by King Shashanka, whose reign corresponds with the beginning of the Bengali calendar. The Pala Empire was founded in Gauda during the 8th century. The empire ruled large parts of the northern Indian subcontinent. Gauda became known as Lakhnauti during the Sena dynasty.[3] Gauda gradually became synonymous with Bengal and Bengalis. It was conquered by the Delhi Sultanate in 1204.</div></footer>

	<div>Pandua (historically known as Hazrat Pandua and Firozabad; also known as Adina) is a historic city of the Indian subcontinent. It was the first capital city of the Bengal Sultanate for 114 years between the mid 14th and mid 15th centuries. It continued to be a "mint town" until the 16th-century. The capital later shifted to Gaur. Pandua was described by travelers as a cosmopolitan administrative, commercial and military base, with a population of natives, royalty, aristocrats and foreigners from across Eurasia.

Pandua was a lost city until it was rediscovered by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in 1808. A detailed study of the city was carried out by Sir Alexander Cunningham. An aerial survey was conducted in 1931 by the Archaeological Survey of India.[1] The notable archaeological sites include the Adina Mosque, the largest mosque in the subcontinent; the Eklakhi Mausoleum; and the Qutb Shahi Mosque. Pandua is located in Malda district in the Indian state of West Bengal near the border with Bangladesh.</div></footer>

	<div>Kadam Rasul are shrines, venerated in various parts of the Muslim world, where a stone containing the footprint of the Prophets (Sm) is supposedly kept. Traditionally, Muslims have believed that whenever Prophet Muhammad (Sm) trod on a rock his foot had left an imprint. Perhaps pilgrims brought these footprints in stone, being portable, back from Makka. They are kept in shrines known as Kadam Sharif or Kadam Rasul Allah or Kadam Mubarak.
	Shrines such as Kadam Rasul have antecedents in both Judaism and Christianity. On the eve of Muslim conquest of Bengal and after, the Dharma worshippers of South-West Bengal comprising the modern Burdwan division used to worship the 'Dharma paduka' (footwear of Dharma). In India Buddhists and Hindus used to worship the sacred footprints of their God and Goddess. We have in the Sanskrit inscriptions such names as Vishnu-padagiri. The early Buddhists reverenced Buddha's footprints ie Buddha-pada. The Muslims always hold the Prophet's relics sacred. The earliest and most famous of the footprint-shrines is the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which marks the place from where the Prophet (Sm) took off on his Night Journey (mir'aj). Before he set off, his foot is supposed to have left a depression on the rock. Other footprints are preserved in Damascus, Cairo and Istambul.</div></footer>
